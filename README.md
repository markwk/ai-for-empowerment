Creativity in the Age of AI â€¢ Foothill College â€¢ Thursday, May 2, 2024

_How might AI enable our creativity and our creative journeys?_ 

Technologist and Music Producer Mark Koester along with Professor Bruce Tambling and music students will dive into the many ways AI can help us make music. In this interactive talk, we will look at the development of music technology and explore recent innovations of AI and non-AI tools for generating music, augmenting technical tasks and enhancing productivity within the music industry. As the music producer of Stellar Mammals, Mark will share his hands-on experience using technology as an enabler, collaborator, and beyond. As a special bonus, we will share a real-world example of AI empowerment happening at Foothill College with music students using Stay Reflective's AI app. Let's harmonize on a meaningful, multimedia exploration of AI's multifaceted impact on creativity, music and ourselves!
