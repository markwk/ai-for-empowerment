<section>
	<p><small>With a design brief, who is the creator? (Boss or illustrator?)</small></p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Prompt-based AI art systems should be considered a new or separate artistic medium.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p><small>(We as artists should acknowledge when we use AI too.)</small></p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Using prompt-based AI art systems often <u>removes us from the creative act</u> and takes you away from being (and feeling like) the creator and true owner of the creative work too.</p>

<section>Music is experiential.</section>
<section>Definition of Music = </p><p>pleasing sounds produced by someone singing, playing instruments or some combination.</section>

	<h2>Reflection</h2>
</section>
<section>
	<p>Reflection is the process of thinking deeply and critically about one's thoughts, actions, challenges, experiences, beliefs, etc. </p>
	<p>•</p>
<p>It involves introspection and self-awareness towards better understanding of oneself, others, and the world.</p>
</section>
<section>Reflection can take many forms.</section>
<section>Reflection can help you in a wide-range of situations.</section>

<section id="expansive-cliff"><p><img data-src="https://markwk.github.io/ai-for-empowerment/images/illustration-expansive-cliffs-without-bridge.png" width="60%"/></p><p><small>We all face challenges whether learning, creative, professional, social or something in-between.</small></p></section>
<section id="facing-paradox"><p>Paradox</p><p><img data-src="https://markwk.github.io/ai-for-empowerment/images/paradox-rendition-01.jpg" width="50%"/></p><p><small>Should you use AI or not?</small></p></section>
<section><p><img data-src="https://markwk.github.io/ai-for-empowerment/images/illustration-expansive-cliffs-with-bridge.png" width="60%"/></p><small>Due to being lazy, busy, or uncertain, we often look for end-to-end wholesale solutions from technology including with AI.</small></section>
<section>But is this the best and only way to leverage AI? (and what are the costs?)</section>
<section>AI should be framed and utilized as a <u>"variable use" tool</u>.</section>
<section>AI should be viewed as a <u>collabrator.</u></section>
<section>...because ultimately AI can and should aim at enabling and empowering us as human beings and human creators.</section>
